# Handwritten-Digit-Detection-from-MNIST-dataset
This Python code takes handwritten digits images from the popular MNIST dataset and accurately predicts which digit is present in the image. The code uses various machine learning models such as KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest to create different prediction models.
