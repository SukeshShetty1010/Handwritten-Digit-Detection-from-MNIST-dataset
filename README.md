# Handwritten-Digit-Detection-from-MNIST-dataset
This Python code takes handwritten digits images from the popular MNIST dataset and accurately predicts which digit is present in the image. The code uses various machine learning models such as KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest to create different prediction models. These models are then tested on the dataset, and their accuracy is compared to determine which model gives the most accurate predictions. This code can be used for various applications, such as recognizing handwritten digits in postal addresses, bank checks, and other important documents. It provides an efficient and accurate way to automate the recognition process, making it easier for businesses and organizations to handle large volumes of data.
